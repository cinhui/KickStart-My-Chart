<b>What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?</b>

The campaigns in this dataset fall under one of 9 categories and 41 sub-categories. The campaigns found in the dataset were created between May 2009 and March 2017. About 53% of campaigns in the dataset were successful. The majority of the campaigns (3038) are based in the US, followed by Great Britain (604) and Canada (146). 

Certain project categories performed better than the others. The categories with the largest number of projects were Theater, Music, Technology, and Film and Video, respectively. Theater had 1393 projects with success rate 58%. Music had 700 projects with success rate 77%. Technology had 600 projects with success rate 35%. Film and video had 520 projects with success rate 60%.

There appears a correlation between the funding goal of the project and whether its successful or not. As the funding goal of the projects increased, the percent of successful projects decreased. As the funding goal of the projects increased, the percent of failed projects increased and also the percent of canceled projects. This suggests projects with a relatively lower funding goal may have higher chance of being successful. The largest number of projects had a funding goal between $1000 and $4999, in which 66.01% of those projects were successful. Projects with a funding goal less than $1000 had a success rate of 71.08%. 

<b>What are some of the limitations of this dataset?</b>

There’s 4114 projects in the dataset, which is a relatively small sample size. There’s 9 categories identified in the dataset - Film & Video, Food, Games, Journalism, Music, Photography, Publishing, Technology, and Theater. Kickstarter has 15 categories for choose from. The dataset doesn’t contain any information on projects under Art, Comics, Crafts, Dance, Design, or Fashion. About one-third of the projects in the dataset where Theater projects, so we would want to check whether the dataset was a random sample that’s representative of the distribution of projects found in Kickstarter during that time frame.

There are other features to consider that may affect the success of campaigns. This may include the quality of the campaign posting, such as amount to text or the usage of videos/photos, or activity on campaign, such as comments by creator and backers, or the rewards for backers.

The location just gives the country. Since most of the projects are from US, it may be more interesting to break it down into states.

<b>What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?</b>
Other possible tables/graphs include: Average success rate over time; Average donation based on category; State by staff pick; State by number of backers; and Funding goals based on categories.
